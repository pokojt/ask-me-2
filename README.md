# Ask Me - Javascript Week 3 Code Review
## By: Taylor Pokoj

##Description

For this project, we were instructed to use Ember JS to create a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers. The app should meet the following objectives: 

- Questions should have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes.
- Answers should have the content of the answer and the author.
- Include a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.
- List all questions on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing.
- Users should be able to click on a question to view additional information.
- Allow users to add and edit questions.
- Allow users to add answers to a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
