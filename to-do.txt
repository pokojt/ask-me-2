TO DO


most important:

- add votes to model and sort as computed property


then:
SERVICE
- service my-favorites to favorite questions (heart icon?). This will go to a link in the nav, like shopping-cart service. favorite counter positioned over icon?

HELPER
- helper to add an icon to popular questions, based on votes? question-popularity
- create a helper to format the time?
- OR a helper to change display of questions with no answers. Maybe one answer could change the color, three, 5, etc?

COMPUTED PROPERTY
-sort answers by vote count or to sort questions by most recent.



- moment-from now not working????
